# Firefox_Proxy_Extension
A simplistic extension for Mozilla Firefox allowing to easily set up proxy settings for the browser 

Analogical to my Chrome_Proxy_Extension repo, but intended to use in the Mozilla Firefox browser.

Though there are native proxy settings within the browser, it's a bit more convenient to use an extension to switch proxy on and off.
